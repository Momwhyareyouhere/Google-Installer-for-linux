# Google-Installer-for-linux

This script works only for debian/ubuntu soon there will be on fedora too maybe also on arch linux.

This script is made only for fun and made also for the people that hate firefox and want remove firefox and install Google.

How does it work:
First it removes firefox then installs Google

Download:
Install the files `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Momwhyareyouhere/Google-Installer-for-linux/refs/heads/main/installer.sh -O installer.sh && sudo bash installer.sh`

If the installer.sh didn't run setup.sh then try this command: `sudo bash setup.sh`
To install again firefox run `sudo bash restore.sh`
